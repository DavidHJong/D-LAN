     * Event types:

     *  - Delete file
     *  - The content of a file changed
     *
     * Behaviors of some special cases:
     *  - Symlinks must be ignored.
     *  - When a directory is added as a shared directory ('addDir(..)') and one or more sub-directories are already shared then
     *    'addDir(..)' is called for the new shared directory and 'rmDir(..)' is called for each old shared sub-directory.
     *  - When a sub-directory of a shared directory is moved as a sub-directory of another shared directory the implementation
     *    can use the events 'DELETED' following by 'NEW' or the event 'MOVE' alone, the last one is preferred.
     *  - When a shared directory is deleted in the file system, the watcher should send a 'DELETE' event. If it does, the 'rmDir(..)' will be
     *    Automatically called for this directory.
